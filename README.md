Form submission handling: This code attaches a submit event listener to the form with the ID "deduction-form." When the form is submitted, it prevents the default form submission behavior (event.preventDefault()) and displays an alert indicating a successful form submission.
Form validation: This code adds another event listener to the form's submit event. Inside the event listener, the validateForm function is called. The validateForm function checks if the required form fields are filled. If any of them are empty, it displays an alert and returns false, preventing the form from being submitted.
Date Range Validation:This code ensures that when the value of the end date input (enddate) changes, it compares the end date with the start date (startdate). If the end date is before the start date, it displays an alert and clears the end date field.
